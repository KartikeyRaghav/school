            <p>“Education is not the learning of facts, but the training of the mind to think.”- Albert Einstein
                As the Principal of the school, I feel honoured and privileged to be part of an educational institution
                which is committed to explore the possible to achieve the impossible and to reach the pinnacle of
                success and to this very purpose, at S. D. Adarsh Vidyalaya every stake holder is deeply devoted.It is
                committed to the holistic development of a student, academic knowledge, social skills, intellectual
                curiosity, physical endurance and a special emphasis on self-discovery. We have a diverse group of
                students and teachers who have wider perspective.The caring and sensitised ethos at S.D. Adarsh
                Vidyalaya has helped our students evolve into caring and achieving members of society and they are
                blossoming into responsible, citizens. At S. D. Adarsh Vidyalaya we lend the platform and work hard
                backstage to applaud our students in all their activities and achievements by being with them, behind
                them and around them. Positive work ethics and the pursuit of excellence has always been our strength.
                In 21st century education is changing constantly and rigorously. Year 2020 has changed it 360°, from
                physical classroom to virtual classrooms, from blackboards to smart boards, and screen sharing -
                education has acquired a completely new dimension and definition. I believe, that S.D. Adarsh Vidyalaya
                is all set in achieving new milestones. Our students are perched like fledgeling birds, eager to spread
                their wings and fly high to reach new heights in all spheres. Thank you so much.</p>
