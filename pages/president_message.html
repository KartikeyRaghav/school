            <p>God has graced every one of us with some special purpose and bestowed upon us unique talent to achieve
                that goal. My thoughts travel back to the days when the foundation of SDAV was first laid and since then
                with its every definite and sure step SDAV has made its mark in the educational scenario of Gurugram. It
                is heartening to see this young sapling growing into a big tree with its many branches. Much we have
                gained yet more is to be achieved.While academic excellence continues to remain the primary focus the
                school is sincerely devoted to prepare students for life, enabling them to face the challenges of
                tomorrow and encouraging them to be socially relevant.In this era of competition, we have to strive hard
                and work relentlessly to prove our potential not only in academics but also in all other spheres of life
                and humanity. So always 'Aspire, Act and Achieve'.Faith in God and Self-reliance will be the real
                guiding force in your life taking you successfully towards your destination.In the coming years, we
                intend to give better impetus to the learning process by making it more participative.
                The milestones of the past must serve as a springboard for the future so that we continue to strive for
                excellence.May School progress in leaps and bounds. With the blessings, I wish each SDAVian great and
                grand success.</p>
