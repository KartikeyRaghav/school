                <p>In January. 1970, on the pressing demand and genuine need of the citizens of Gurugram, Shri Sanatan
                    Dharam Adarsh Vidyalaya Society, Gurugram was setup under the auspices of Smt. Bhagwati Vasishtha,
                    educationist and an eminent lawyer, Pt. Hari Ram Shastri and Pt. BasantLal Sharma were pioneers
                    whose
                    untiring efforts contributed immensely. Today the school is being run by an efficient management
                    under
                    the presidentship of a dynamic educationist Smt. Asha Sharma. Under her expertise, the school has
                    grown
                    by leaps and bounds. She has successfully set up a new building in the spacious, sylvan surroundings
                    on
                    Sohna Road, Gurugram.</p>

                <p>S.D. Adarsh Vidyalaya is a co-educational English Medium Senior Secondary School. One of the
                    objectives
                    of the institution is to initiate the students to the rich cultural heritage of our county and to
                    provide the basic concept of the religion. Besides inculcating patriotic spirit and grooming
                    children
                    into worthy citizens, the school also develops a cosmopolitan outlook. The physical, cultural and
                    intellectual developments of the children receive utmost care. The school attaches great importance
                    to
                    various scholastic and co-scholastic activities besides the class routine. These activities are
                    designed
                    to develop valuable traits of character such as self-confidence, diligence and competitive spirit
                    among
                    the students.</p>
